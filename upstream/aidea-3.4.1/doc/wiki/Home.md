# AIdea

AIdea is a free and open-source AI assistant for Zotero. It lets you chat with AI directly inside Zotero, work with paper context, and sign in with supported providers using your existing account instead of manually configuring API keys.

## What AIdea Does

- Chat with AI in the Zotero library side panel and PDF reader side panel
- Attach selected PDF text as context for grounded Q&A
- Use quick actions like summarize, explain, and translate
- Export responses to Zotero notes with Markdown and LaTeX support
- Keep persistent local chat history
- Use a local memory system to carry useful context across conversations
- Sign in with OpenAI, Gemini, Qwen, and GitHub Copilot

## Why People Use It

AIdea is designed for research workflows. Instead of switching between Zotero, browsers, and external AI apps, you can stay inside your library while reading papers, selecting passages, and asking targeted questions.
